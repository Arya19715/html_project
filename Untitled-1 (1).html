    <h1>Unsaid Feelings</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><h4>I should know better. Only a crazy person would keep trying the same thing hoping to get a different result. 
    The writing on the wall is in plain black and white. You're straight. You won't ever look at me the way I look at you. 
    Call me crazy, I'll keep digging myself deeper into this hole out of my obsession with you. I want to tell you how much I appreciate you. Because I do. 
    I don’t know if you get letters like this often, maybe you do, but you need to know how much I care for you. I want you to be happy. 
    Thank you for being a friend. It’s alright if you don’t feel the same way about me, I get it. I just think you should know how I feel. 
    Thank you. I’m so in love with you. It is sickening. I can’t get you off my mind, I can’t seem to find ways to get over you. 
    I just want you. I want you so much. I can't fathom the reason why my body still cripples when he shows up on the screen of my phone. 
    His gaze is the same, as well as his smile. His hair is freshly cut and it draws a sturdy straight line on his back, visible even though his body is moving. 
    How can it be so perfect? I suddenly realize, I've never paid attention to his eyes. It just captivates me, I am enthralled by his smile and the way he talk to me. 
    How have I never noticed it before? Just like that, my heart is pacing while my mind is like not again. A new, I am dropped into a trap I built myself. 
    I am still holding onto something that used to exist. Something that, genuinely, never existed. Something that, maybe, could've existed. 
    While my neurodivergent brain was trying to process my depression, I saw his as the only light. And to this day I can't let go of the idea I had and unconsciously have of him.</h4></p><br>
